      <h1 class="pitch-title">Getting Started with SweetSpot</h1>
      <p class="text soundness-text">Before running your first price test, we need to make sure SweetSpot is set-up correctly.</p>
      <h2 class="pitch-title">1. Identifying price elements</h2>

      <p class="text soundness-text">SweetSpot needs to be aware of where to apply its magic. To achieve this, we need to tag a few key elements in the template to make SweetSpot aware of them. This is done by editing your theme's liquid templates.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Every element containing a price should have a `sweetspot__price` class, and a `data-sweetspot-id` attribute containing the variant id to which the price belongs to.</li>
        <li>Option elements in the variant selector should have a `sweetspot-option` class.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="pitch-title">2. Making sure visitors see no duplicated products</h2>

      <p class="text soundness-text">To enable the same product to be checked out with different prices, SweetSpot needs to duplicate products. All product variants SweetSpot creates, have `sweetspot-variant` set as product type. To make sure no duplicates show up in your collections, you can add the condition `Product type is not equal to sweetspot-variant` to your collections.</p>

      <h2 class="pitch-title">3. Applying price after client-side DOM changes</h2>

      <p class="text soundness-text">This step only applies if your theme manipulates price elements with client-side JavaScript. In this case, SweetSpot needs to run after any such changes for it to display the right price. To do this, you can call the `window.SweetSpot.apply()` function.</p>

      <h2 class="pitch-title">Ready to test</h2>

      <p class="text soundness-text">That's all there is to it. SweetSpot is now ready to run price tests! If you need further assistance with setting up, you can reach us at <a href="mailto:hello@wavelength.dev">hello@wavelength.dev</a>.</p>
