          price of your products. It helps you find the optimal point on the
          price elasticity curve resulting in increased profits for your
          business.

          Most serious store-owners spend considerable effort on A/B testing
          various landing page designs, color schemes, and checkout flows.
          Despite this, few of us put effort into making sure our pricing is
          equally optimized. Finding a more profitable price for a product is
          one of the best ways to make your business stronger.

          SweetSpot works just like regular A/B testing:
        </p>
        <ul class="steps-list">
          <li>
            Select a control price and a test price for one or more products
          </li>
          <li>Start the experiment!</li>
          <li>
            Let the experiment run until it reaches a statistically significant
            result
          </li>
          <li>Adjust the price accordingly</li>
        </ul>

        When conducting any scientific experiment, it's essential to control for
        confounding variables. For example, if you change the price of a product
        from one week to the next, there's no way of knowing the impact of the
        change on your profits. It might just be that more people bought more
        the other week because it happened to be when they received their
        salaries. In this case, you might get mislead into switching to a price
        that may even perform worse than the original.
      </p>

        This is why you want to base crucial business decisions, such as the
        price of your product, on statistically significant results. Luckily,
        you don't need to be a Data Scientist to use SweetSpot! It has been
        built from the ground up to deliver reliable results using an
        easy-to-use interface.

            Our team has a long track record of working on high-traffic websites
            of some of the world's leading brands. We understand that any
            downtime or issues can quickly add up to a lot of lost revenue.
            That's why we built SweetSpot on state-of-the-art infrastructure
            using high-assurance software development practices.

            Before releasing SweetSpot to the Shopify App Store, we wanted to
            make sure that it can deliver the kind of results we're promising,
            so we ran price experiments with early testers. In one of these
            experiments, a 10% increase in price led to a 30% increase in
            profit!

            Price testing is by no means a new invention. Airlines, hotels, and
            large e-commerce companies have been doing dynamic pricing and price
            optimization for a long time. Until now, their strategies haven't
            been accessible to Shopify merchants, but we're here to change that.
