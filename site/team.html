            <p class="teammember-name">Niclas</p>
            <p class="text soundness-text">Niclas has been working as a software engineer and consultant for close to a decade. During this time, he has worked on in-flight entertainment systems, video streaming platforms, public transport ticketing apps, and large-scale ecommerce platforms. Within ecommerce, he has worked with brands such as Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger, and Bestseller.  Some things Niclas enjoys are functional programming, statistics, playing music, and lifting weights.</p>

            <p class="text soundness-text">Having an interest in getting at the hard facts, discovering a best price using bayesian statistics sounded worthwhile from the get-go. Working with Rituals, Calvin Klein, and adidas, the impact of well-written and data-driven software seemed obvious. Regularly ending up in discussions about the value of not knowing or being wrong and favoring learning what is right, the time came to prove the value of this philosophy. Personally, I like to intersperse months of hard work with excellent live music and adventures with friends.</p>
